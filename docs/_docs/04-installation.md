## Installation

**Notice:** [Azure IoT Workbench](https://aka.ms/iot-workbench) is the new tool for developing on IoT DevKit. If you are looking for old experiences by using the installer, you can find it [here]({{"/docs/legacy/installation" | absolute_url}}).
{: .notice--warning}



Please follow this [tutorial]({{"/docs/get-started/#install-development-environment" | absolute_url}}) to setup the development environment for developing on IoT DevKit.

We suggest you use the [installation package]({{"/docs/get-started/#a-download-latest-package" | absolute_url}}) to install everything automatically. If you have problems on using the one-click install experience, follow these  steps to manually install tools and packages for IoT DevKit development. 

## Next Steps

You are all set! It's time to build your first IoT application by following instructions in [Projects Catalog]({{"/docs/projects/" | absolute_url }}).
