In this project, you will create an Azure IoT Hub, connect DevKit to it, and collect the temperature and humidity data from sensors and send the data to the IoT hub.

## What you learn

* How to create an IoT Hub and register a device for MXChip IoT DevKit.
* How to collect sensor data by running a sample application on MXChip IoT DevKit.
* How to send the sensor data to your IoT hub.

## What you need

Finish the [Getting Started Guide]({{"/docs/get-started/" | absolute_url }}) to:

* Have your DevKit connected to Wi-Fi
* Prepare the development environment

An active Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can register via one of the methods:

* Activate a [free 30-day trial Microsoft Azure account](https://azureinfo.microsoft.com/us-freetrial.html){:target="_blank"}
* Claim your [Azure credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/){:target="_blank"} if you are MSDN or Visual Studio subscriber

## Step 1. Open the project folder

### A. Start VS Code

Make sure your DevKit is not connected. Start VS Code first and connect the DevKit to your computer. VS Code automatically finds the DevKit and opens an introduction page:

![Introduction page]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/vscode_start.png" | absolute_url }})

**Notice:** Occasionally, when you launch VS Code, you are prompted with error that cannot find Arduino IDE or related board package. Close VS Code, launch Arduino IDE once again, and VS Code should locate Arduino IDE path correctly.
{: .notice--warning}

### B. Open the Arduino Examples folder

Expand left side **ARDUINO EXAMPLES** section, browse to **Examples for MXCHIP AZ3166 > AzureIoT**, and select **GetStarted**. This will open a new VS Code window with project folder in it.

![Arduino Examples tab]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/vscode_examples.png" | absolute_url }})

If you happen to close the pane, you can reopen it. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type **Arduino**, and then find and select **Arduino: Examples**.

## Step 2. Provision Azure services

In the solution window, run your task through `Ctrl+P` (macOS: `Cmd+P`) by entering `task cloud-provision`:

In the VS Code terminal, an interactive command line guides you through provisioning the required Azure services:

![Interactive command line]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/cloud-provision.png" | absolute_url }})

**Notice:** If the page hangs in the loading status when trying to sign in to Azure, plese check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#page-hangs-when-log-in-azure" | absolute_url}}) to solve it. 
{: .notice--warning}

## Step 3. Build and upload Arduino sketch

{% include switch.html content = page.variable %}

#### Windows

1. Use `Ctrl+P` to run `task config-device-connection`.
2. The terminal will ask you whether you want to use connection string that retrieves from `task cloud-provision` step. You could also input your own device connection string by clicking 'Create New...'
3. The terminal prompts you to enter configuration mode. To do so, hold down button A, then push and release the reset button. The screen displays the DevKit id and 'Configuration'.

![Verification and upload of the Arduino sketch]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/config-device-connection.png" | absolute_url }})

4. After `task config-device-connection` finished, click `F1` to load VS Code commands and select `Arduino: Upload`, then VS Code starts verifying and uploading the Arduino sketch:

![Verification and upload of the Arduino sketch]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/arduino-upload.png" | absolute_url }})

The DevKit reboots and starts running the code.

**Notice:** Occasionally, you get error "Error: AZ3166: Unknown package". This is due to the board package index is not refreshed. Check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#development" | absolute_url}}) to solve it.
{: .notice--warning}

#### macOS

1. Put DevKit into configuration mode:
  Hold down button A, then push and release the reset button. The screen displays 'Configuration'.
2. Use `Cmd+P` to run `task config-device-connection`.
3. The terminal will ask you whether you want to use connection string that retrieves from `task cloud-provision` step. You could also input your own device connection string by clicking 'Create New...'

![device-upload]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/config-device-connection.png" | absolute_url }})

4. After `task config-device-connection` finished, click `Cmd + shift + p` to load VS Code commands and select `Arduino: Upload`, then VS Code starts verifying and uploading the Arduino sketch:

![device-upload]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/arduino-upload.png" | absolute_url }})

The DevKit reboots and starts running the code.

**Notice:** Occasionally, you get error "Error: AZ3166: Unknown package". This is due to the board package index is not refreshed. Check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#development" | absolute_url}}) to solve it.

## Test the project

In VS Code, following these steps to open and set up the Serial Monitor:

1. Click the `COM[X]` word on the status bar to set the right COM port with `STMicroelectronics`:
  ![com-port]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/com-port.png" | absolute_url }})

2. Click power plug icon on the status bar to open the Serial Monitor:
  ![serial-monitor]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/serial-monitor.png" | absolute_url }})

3. On the status bar, click the number that represents the Baud Rate and set to `115200`:
  ![baud-rate]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/baud-rate.png" | absolute_url }})

The sample application is running successfully when you see the following results:

* The Serial Monitor displays the same information as the content in the screenshot below.
* The LED on MXChip IoT DevKit is blinking.

![Final output in VS Code]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/connect-iothub/result-serial-output.png" | absolute_url }})

## Customize device ID

You can customize device ID in IoT Hub by following [this doc]({{"/docs/customize-device-id/" | absolute_url }}), however, you still need to change the hardcoding `AZ3166` to customized device ID in the code currently. Here's the list of files you need to modify:

* [config.h](https://github.com/Microsoft/devkit-sdk/blob/master/AZ3166/src/libraries/AzureIoT/examples/GetStarted/config.h#L9)

## Problems and feedback

If you encounter problems, you can find [FAQs]({{"/docs/faq/" | absolute_url }}) if you encounter problems or reach out to us from the channels below.

## Next steps

You have successfully connected an MXChip IoT DevKit to your IoT hub, and you have sent the captured sensor data to your IoT hub.
