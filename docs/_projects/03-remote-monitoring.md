In this tutorial, you learn how to run a sample app on DevKit to send sensor data to your Azure IoT Suite.

{% include toc icon="columns" %}

## What you need

Finish the [Getting Started Guide]({{"/docs/get-started/" | absolute_url }}) to:

* Have your DevKit connected to Wi-Fi
* Prepare the development environment

An active Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can register via one of the methods:

* Activate a [free 30-day trial Microsoft Azure account](https://azureinfo.microsoft.com/us-freetrial.html){:target="_blank"}
* Claim your [Azure credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/){:target="_blank"} if you are MSDN or Visual Studio subscriber

## Step 1. Create an Azure IoT Suite

1. Go to [Azure IoT Suite site](https://www.azureiotsuite.com/) and click **Create a new solution**.

![remote-monitoring-azure-iot-suite-solution-types]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-solution-types.png" | absolute_url }})

2. Select **Remote monitoring**.

3. Enter a solution name, select a subscription and a region, and then click **Create solution**. The solution may take a while to be provisioned.

![remote-monitoring-azure-iot-suite-new-solution]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-new-solution.png" | absolute_url }})

4. After the provision is completed, click **Launch**. Some simulated devices are created for the solution during the provision process. Click **DEVICES** to check them out.

![remote-monitoring-azure-iot-suite-new-solution-created]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-new-solution-created.png" | absolute_url }})

![remote-monitoring-azure-iot-suite-console]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-console.png" | absolute_url }})

5. Click **ADD A DEVICE**.

6. Click **Add New** for **Custom Device**.

![remote-monitoring-azure-iot-suite-add-new-device]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-add-new-device.png" | absolute_url }})

7. Click **Let me define my own Device ID**, enter `AZ3166`, and then click **Create**.

![remote-monitoring-azure-iot-suite-new-device-configuration]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/azure-iot-suite-new-device-configuration.png" | absolute_url }})

8. Make a note of **IoT Hub Hostname**, and click **Done**.

## Step 2. Open the RemoteMonitoring sample

1. Disconnect DevKit from your computer if it is connected.

2. Start VS Code.

3. Connect DevKit to your computer. VS Code automatically detects your DevKit and opens the following pages:
  * Preview README.md: The DevKit introduction page.
  * Arduino Examples: Hands-on samples to get started with DevKit.

4. Expand left side **ARDUINO EXAMPLES** section, browse to **Examples for MXCHIP AZ3166 > AzureIoT**, and select **RemoteMonitoring**. This will open a new VS Code window with project folder in it.

![mini-solution-vscode]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-vscode.png" | absolute_url }})

If you happen to close the pane, you can reopen it. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type **Arduino**, and then find and select **Arduino: Examples**.

## Step 3. Provision required Azure services

1. In the RemoteMonitoring sample window, use `Ctrl+P` (macOS: `Cmd+P`), type `task cloud`, and then click **cloud-provision**.
The cloud-provision task opens an interactive command line that guides you through provisioning the required Azure services.

2. In the interactive command line, select the IoT hub represented by the IoT Hub Hostname that you noted down.

3. Wait for the provision to complete.

![remote-monitoring-provision]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/provision.png" | absolute_url }})

## Step 4. Build and upload the device code

{% include switch.html content = page.variable %}

### Windows

1. Use `Ctrl+P` to run `task device-upload`.
2. The terminal prompts you to enter configuration mode. To do so, hold down button A, then push and release the reset button. The screen displays the DevKit id and 'Configuration'.

This is to set the connection string that retrieves from `task cloud-provision` step.

Then VS Code starts verifying and uploading the Arduino sketch:

![device-upload]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/build.png" | absolute_url }})

The DevKit reboots and starts running the code.

**Notice:** Occasionally, you get error "Error: AZ3166: Unknown package". This is due to the board package index is not refreshed. Check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#development" | absolute_url}}) to solve it.
{: .notice--warning}

### macOS

1. Put DevKit into configuration mode:
  Hold down button A, then push and release the reset button. The screen displays 'Configuration'.
2. Use `Cmd+P` to run `task device-upload`.

This is to set the connection string that retrieves from `task cloud-provision` step.

Then it starts verifying and uploading the Arduino sketch:

![device-upload]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/remote-monitoring/build.png" | absolute_url }})

The DevKit reboots and starts running the code.

**Notice:** Occasionally, you get error "Error: AZ3166: Unknown package". This is due to the board package index is not refreshed. Check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#development" | absolute_url}}) to solve it.
{: .notice--warning}

## Test the project

When the sample app runs, DevKit sends sensor data over Wi-Fi to your Azure IoT Suite. To see the result, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Azure IoT Suite, and click **DASHBOARD**.

2. Azure IoT Suite solution console, you will see DevKit sensor status.
