In this project, you learn how to use the MQTT Client library to send messages to an MQTT broker.
The MQTT client library we used is part of the [Eclipse Paho](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/) project, which provides APIs for using MQTT over multiple means of transport.

## What you need

Finish the [Getting Started Guide]({{"/docs/get-started/" | absolute_url }}) to:

* Have your DevKit connected to Wi-Fi
* Prepare the development environment

## Step 1. Open the project folder

1. Disconnect DevKit from your computer if it is connected.

2. Start VS Code.

3. Connect DevKit to your computer.
    VS Code automatically detects your DevKit and opens the following pages:
    * Preview â€˜README.md: The DevKit introduction page.
    * Arduino Examples: Hands-on samples to get started with DevKit.

    ![mini-solution-vscode]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-vscode.png" | absolute_url }})

## Step 2. Open the MQTTClient Sample

Expand left side **ARDUINO EXAMPLES** section, browse to **Examples for MXCHIP AZ3166 > MQTT**, and select **MQTTClient**. This will open a new VS Code window with project folder in it.

![examples-folder]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/mqtt-helloworld/examples.png" | absolute_url}})

If you happen to close the pane, you can reopen it. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type **Arduino**, and then find and select **Arduino: Examples**.

## Step 3. Build and upload Arduino sketch

Type `Ctrl+P` (macOS: `Cmd+P`) to run `task device-upload`. Once the upload is completed, DevKit restarts and runs the sample.

![device-upload]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/mqtt-helloworld/device-upload.jpg" | absolute_url}})

**Notice:** Occasionally, you get error "Error: AZ3166: Unknown package". This is due to the board package index is not refreshed. Check this [FAQ steps]({{"/docs/faq/#development" | absolute_url}}) to solve it.

## Test the project

In VS Code, following these steps to open and set up the Serial Monitor:

1. Click the `COM[X]` word on the status bar to set the right COM port with `STMicroelectronics`:
  ![set-com-port]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/mqtt-helloworld/set-com-port.jpg" | absolute_url}})

2. Click power plug icon on the status bar to open the Serial Monitor:
  ![serial-monitor]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/mqtt-helloworld/serial-monitor.jpg" | absolute_url}})
  
3. On the status bar, click the number that represents the Baud Rate and set to `115200`:
  ![set-baud-rate]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution/mqtt-helloworld/set-baud-rate.jpg" | absolute_url}})

The Serial Monitor displays all the messages sent from the sample. When the sample runs, it connects DevKit to Wi-Fi. When the connection is successful, the sample sends a message to the MQTT broker. After that, the sample repeatedly sends two "iot.eclipse.org" messages using QoS 0 and QoS 1, respectively.
